# Preparing the Environment

## Overview

In this chapter, we will set up the environment required for the course. This includes installing necessary libraries and tools.

## Topics Covered

- Installing Libraries
- Setting Up Jupyter Notebook
- Alternative: Installing Anaconda or Miniconda

## Installing Libraries

To get started, we need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install tqdm notebook==7.1.2 openai elasticsearch pandas scikit-learn
```

## Setting Up Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used in data science and machine learning.

To start Jupyter Notebook, run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Alternative: Installing Anaconda or Miniconda

Anaconda and Miniconda are popular distributions of Python and R for scientific computing and data science. They come with a package manager called `conda` that makes it easy to install and manage packages.

To install Anaconda, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

To install Miniconda, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
